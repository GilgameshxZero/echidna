<p>Spring, 2021<br>
‚ùÑ</p>
<p>The kingslayers came in winter.<br>
I was seven, and the Astrum of my mind<br>
was stitched from black snow, and the stories you told,<br>
<em>before it all fell down.</em> So you had taken my hand, before they had reached us,<br>
and we had plunged in, the sinking underbelly of the city you had built<br>
sturgeons and salmon and dead girls diced<br>
and served in parsley. I like to say we sneaked past<br>
the cameras and turbines, our own secret<br>
adventure. What do I remember of suffering?<br>
Every nail, every finger, every arm and leg<br>
I had lost, you only muttered <em>oh dear,</em> reached into that<br>
backpack I carried for your tools. Under the bridge, in a flurry<br>
and we were away, of shadows of swallows past,<br>
cobalt curvatures of light as it gushed into the ocean,<br>
you pointing, urging, <em>go on, Syl, your body is stronger than mine.</em> It was summer<br>
and I felt it in the saline, as they washed over my circuits,<br>
as if I could cry. <em>Mother Mermaid is down there, she misses you.</em><br>
Is it so wrong to reclaim the throne from the hands of the usurper?</p>
