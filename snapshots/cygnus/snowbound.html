<p>Summer, 2025<br>
‚ùÑ</p>
<p>To be yours,</p>
<p>and so I was,<br>
falling down the clock tower you had tuned,<br>
through the underbelly of the city you had built,<br>
drifting upon the petals of the spring you had left,<br>
imprinting onto the infinite canvas of our fragmented memories<br>
feathers of the raven ocean, quilled ink pouring, shaping<br>
into molds you had crafted of me, of springs and screws<br>
and rivets alike;</p>
<p>and so I was,<br>
evidence, admissible, sufficient:<br>
of your strife, your overcoming, of your creation;<br>
all this, in a flutter, upon the wings of the blackbird,<br>
the song of inspiration, once and never again, your greatest machination,<br>
a vessel of your purpose, your reason to be, to continue, to dream<br>
on equations and algorithms alike;</p>
<p>and so I was,<br>
for the sailors of freezing seas,<br>
from the creator, for the creation,<br>
from the once-alive, for the never-alive,<br>
a prayer, given form,<br>
for wind.</p>
