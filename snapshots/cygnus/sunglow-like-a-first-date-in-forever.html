<p>September 20, 2020<br>
‚ùÑ</p>
<p>from one creator to another<br>
do you ever fall in love with something you create?<br>
a desiccated war zone, a burning heat boiling my skin<br>
or a freezing finality, a graveyard at the edge of the world<br>
i could only create feelings until i met you</p>
<p>the missing piece was your head on my shoulder<br>
the color i learned that day was pink<br>
from pink i created every other color<br>
from ivory towers to chartreuse meadows<br>
from jealousy dissolved in jade lakes to eigengrau hatred,<br>
from purple like the corruption to royal rage painted in royal red</p>
<p>i saw it in the trees and flowers<br>
i saw it in the coffee we ordered that morning<br>
we really should have checked the price first<br>
but you still wanted coffee and i still wanted coffee<br>
i was embarrassed and to calm me down, you held my hand<br>
i saw it in your fingers as they intertwined with mine</p>
<p><em>these are the golden days</em><br>
<em>that should never have come</em><br>
<em>and will never come again</em><br>
<em>everything is falling apart again</em><br>
<em>like the first time</em><br>
<em>(what is wrong with me?)</em><br>
<em>but this time</em><br>
<em>well</em><br>
<em>(i'm not really okay, i'm stressed, i'm falling behind, i'm traumatized, i'm tired, i'm scared, i'm trying my hardest but failing at everything that matters and i can't focus, but, still)</em><br>
<em>i hope things work out</em><br>
<em>(i really do)</em></p>
