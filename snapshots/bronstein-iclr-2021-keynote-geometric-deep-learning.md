Erlangen: unifying framework.

GDL aims to provide a unifying framework for good ML ideas and architectures. By analyzing the structure of the input data, can establish equivarance and invariance.

An equivariant transformation is not affected by symmetries in the input; an invariant transformation is.

* Convolutional layers are equivariant.
* Pooling layers are invariant.

Similar synonyms can be found in transformers/attention, as well as GNNs. Thus, the equivariant/invariant structure is strong and indicative of good ideas in ML.

Commonly, input structures are some sort of manifold; thus equivariance on manifolds is important, as well as determining the manifold structure of the input.
