* What do you think about gambling?

> The way you make games that are good is to start by making games that are bad and then getting better at it. The way to get better is to enable those critical facilities while looking at your own games and figuring out what’s wrong.

> In society, being too critical might be seen as negative. My own eye that I turn on myself is even more critical; the speed at which people get better is dependent on the degree to which people think their own work is bad.

Contemporary art scene is akin to a fashion scene—it doesn’t matter that the art didn’t take much skill to execute; the point is the idea behind it.

> I am not a fan of that art. Sometimes, the things I find beautiful are those that take time or care to execute.
