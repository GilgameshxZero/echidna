A square matrix $A$ is PSD iff all vectors $\mathbf{b}$ are transformed non-negatively by it. That is,

$$A\mathbf{b}$$

must have a positive projection back onto $\mathbf{b}$. Alternatively, the matrix *(right-)conjugated* with $b$ is non-negative:

$$\mathbf{b}^TA\mathbf{b}\geq 0.$$

PSD-ness is a property of matrix transformations. A PSD matrix is not necessarily symmetric, though SPSD matrices come up fairly often.
