Problems I’m thinking about.

## 1 Min gap

Given unsorted integral array $A$, $|A|=N$, find in $O(N)$ the minimu pair of consecutive numbers, were $A$ to be sorted.

The solution is likely randomized.

## 2 SCC contraction

Given the condensation graph $G^{SCC}$ of $G$, contract a given edge and and arising cycles of the condensation graph in $O(1)$ amortized. This should maintain the acyclic property of the condensation graph.

## Khintchine’s inequality
