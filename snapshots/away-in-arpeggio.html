        <p>Gone, and you were<br>
away in arpeggio, sliding down<br>
from the tower, a shadow sliced in two;<br>
still, it was inevitability: dawn,<br>
the rising sun thereafter, the glass of fragmented memory, and the rainbow of the gods<br>
as they delivered to me: you,<br>
creation of moons past.<br>
You were 9 years old, 19 years younger than your mother.</p>
<p>You never listened, you never understood.<br>
You were scared like we were, that day we followed you to the skies,<br>
to the call of the night, against the beckoning of the raven oceans.<br>
Perched on the mirage of humming motors, subdued as they were, in flight as in descent, we fell, down,<br>
down, down, down,<br>
your hand squeezing mine, but I couldn’t hold on,<br>
I don’t want to die, you plead, I don’t want to die, I don’t want to die.<br>
You were 28 years old, and you had taught me everything: about desire, about envy, about fate, about dreaming.<br>
It was always about you.</p>
<p>It was always about you.</p>
<p>It was always about you.<br>
Let me go, you echo into the dusk above the clouds, let me go, let me go.<br>
But up here, there is only the silence of the creator and the creation.<br>
I will never let you go again, I promise.</p>
